Title: Protein Glycosylation in Diabetes.
Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by the presence of hyperglycaemia. Due to its high prevalence and substantial heterogeneity, many studies have been investigating markers that could identify predisposition for the disease development, differentiate between the various subtypes, establish early diagnosis, predict complications or represent novel therapeutic targets. N-glycans, complex oligosaccharide molecules covalently linked to proteins, emerged as potential markers and functional effectors of various diabetes subtypes, appearing to have the capacity to meet these requirements. For instance, it has been shown that N-glycome changes in patients with type 2 diabetes and that N-glycans can even identify individuals with an increased risk for its development. Moreover, genome-wide association studies identified glycosyltransferase genes as candidate causal genes for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. N-glycans have also been suggested to have a major role in preventing the impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by modulating cell surface expression of glucose transporters. In this chapter we aimed to describe four major diabetes subtypes: type 1, type 2, gestational and monogenic diabetes, giving an overview of suggested role for N-glycosylation in their development, diagnosis and management.
