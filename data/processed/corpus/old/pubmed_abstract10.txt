Title: α1,3-fucosylation of MEST promotes invasion potential of cytotrophoblast cells by activating translation initiation.
Abstract: Embryo implantation into the uterus is the gateway for successful pregnancy. Proper migration and invasion of embryonic trophoblast cells are the key for embryo implantation, and dysfunction causes pregnancy failure. Protein glycosylation plays crucial roles in reproduction. However, it remains unclear whether the glycosylation of trophoblasts is involved in trophoblast migration and invasion processes during embryo implantation failure. By Lectin array, we discovered the decreased α1,3-fucosylation, especially difucosylated Lewis Y (LeY) glycan, in the villus tissues of miscarriage patients when compared with normal pregnancy women. Downregulating LeY biosynthesis by silencing the key enzyme fucosyltransferase IV (FUT4) inhibited migration and invasion ability of trophoblast cells. Using proteomics and translatomics, the specific LeY scaffolding glycoprotein of mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST) with glycosylation site at Asn163 was identified, and its expression enhanced migration and invasion ability of trophoblast cells. The results also provided novel evidence showing that decreased LeY modification on MEST hampered the binding of MEST with translation factor eIF4E2, and inhibited implantation-related gene translation initiation, which caused pregnancy failure. The α1,3-fucosylation of MEST by FUT4 may serve as a new biomarker for evaluating the functional state of pregnancy, and a target for infertility treatment.
