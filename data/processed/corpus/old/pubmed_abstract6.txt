Title: Immunoglobulin G Glycosylation in Diseases.
Abstract: Changes in immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation pattern have been observed in a vast array of auto- and alloimmune, infectious, cardiometabolic, malignant, and other diseases. This chapter contains an updated catalog of over 140 studies within which IgG glycosylation analysis was performed in a disease setting. Since the composition of IgG glycans is known to modulate its effector functions, it is suggested that a changed IgG glycosylation pattern in patients might be involved in disease development and progression, representing a predisposition and/or a functional effector in disease pathology. In contrast to the glycopattern of bulk serum IgG, which likely relates to the systemic inflammatory background, the glycosylation profile of antigen-specific IgG probably plays a direct role in disease pathology in several infectious and allo- and autoimmune antibody-dependent diseases. Depending on the specifics of any given disease, IgG glycosylation read-out might therefore in the future be developed into a useful clinical biomarker or a supplementary to currently used biomarkers.
