# CarboCurator - Glycan-Disease Text Mining Pipeline

This repository contains a set of tools for mining glycan-related biomarker information from PubMed abstracts. The pipeline includes a PubMed abstract fetcher and a ChatGPT API-based NER tool to extract biological entitiesâ€”specifically glycan epitopes/structural terms and disease associations.

## Features

- **PubMed Abstract Fetcher**  
  Fetches abstracts using a custom query and outputs a table with PMIDs, titles, abstracts, keywords, and MeSH IDs.

- **ChatGPT API Integration**  
  Processes abstracts with the ChatGPT API to identify and extract glycan-related entities and disease associations.
